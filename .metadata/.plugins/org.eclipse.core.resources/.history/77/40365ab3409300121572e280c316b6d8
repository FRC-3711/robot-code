/* Strategy for Autonomous Mode
 * 
 * We don't have any sensors on our robot that will allow us to run feedback loops, so instead of
 * driving from behind the pyramid, turning and firing at the small target, the robot will be touching
 * the back of the pyramid but aimed at the middle target. The lifter will raise until the upper limit
 * switch engages and then it will lower for a short amount of time. When autonomous is engaged, the comp
 * will charge up. Later on the motors will spin up to a preset speed and will fire 3 shots after a short
 * delay
 */

/* Timing
 * 
 * Upon auto mode: Compressor
 * 
 * Raise thingy until switch engages
 * 
 * start timer at that point
