FIRST Robotics code for Trout Lake School / 3711

==========

Team 3711, the Trout Lake School Iron Mustangs, is a FIRST Robotics Competition team from rural Trout Lake High School
(total attendance roughly 60), located just south of Mt. Adams and on the outskirts of the Columbia Gorge in southern Washington. Founded in 2011, the Iron Mustangs were FRC Portland Regional winners their first two
seasons.

This repository contains code dating back to the 2013 Ultimate Ascent robot (Phatt Max), when team 3711 switched from
LabView to C++ code.

The project uses the CommandBasedRobot structure, although 2013 and 2014 competition code does not implement most of the
CommandBased features, using an iterative approach. This repository is made public so that we and other teams may track 
our development over the years and, hopefully, learn from our mistakes!
