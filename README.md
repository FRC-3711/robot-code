FIRST Robotics code for Trout Lake School / 3711

==========

Team 3711, the Trout Lake School Iron Mustangs, is a FIRST Robotics Competition team from rural Trout Lake High School
(total attendance roughly 60). Founded in 2011, the Iron Mustangs were FRC Portland Regional winners their first two
seasons.

This repository contains code dating back to the 2013 Ultimate Ascent robot (Phatt Max), when team 3711 switched from
LabView to C++ code.
